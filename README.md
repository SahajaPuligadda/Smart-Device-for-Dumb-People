# Smart-Device-for-Dumb-People

There are situations where dumb people cannot find any medium to convey their message (ex: paper and pen). 
Hence, we created a user friendly interface using python, where a keyboard and some of the commonly used words are provided along with extra space to type desired text. 
When the user clicks 'OK', the data written in the provided space is converted to speech using the text to speech tool.
