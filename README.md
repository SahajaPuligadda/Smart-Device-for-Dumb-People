# Smart-Device-for-Dumb-People
Raspberry Pi and Python Kivy

There are situations where dumb people cannot find any medium to convey their message (ex: paper and pen). 
Hence, we created a user friendly interface using python, where a keyboard and some of the commonly used words are provided along with extra space to type desired text. 
When the user clicks 'OK', the data written in the provided space is converted to speech using the text to speech tool.

Components Required:

> Langauge: Python

> Python modules: Kivy, gtts

> Raspberry Pi (optional)

> Touch screen interfaceable with raspberry pi (optional)

Inputs:

> Commonly used words (already created as buttons)

> Any text (space given on the right side)

Working:

> Used Kivy module and python language to create a GUI for the project.

> Used gTTs module to convert text to speech.

> Programmed raspberry Pi with the python code and interfaced it with an LCD touch screen to verify the output.

Validation:

> Open the GUI, click on any commonly used words. It is automatically converted to audio.

> Else, click on the empty space and type any desired text. Then, click 'OK' to convert it to speech.

Outputs:

> Audio of given text is played instantly and also saved into a file.
